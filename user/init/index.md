Once you click the link in the email, Thycotic Access Control will redirect your browser to the registration process. As part of this process Thycotic Access Control will identify the type of browser you are using and offer up the appropriate browser extension for you to install. You should be redirected to a screen that looks like the one below.

On this screen you will be shown icons for the various types of browser extensions that Thycotic provides to end users.

Once you click on the highlighted icon (in this case Google Chrome), Thycotic will take you to the Browser Extension store (For Chrome and Firefox) and help you install the browser extension from there one. For Internet Explorer and Safari you may be presented with a downloadable piece of software that you may need to install.

You then choose to install the browser extension. You will see similar links to install the browser extension from
the Firefox Add Ons store area.

Please click on the “Add to Chrome” or “Add to Firefox” or “Install” links.

## Registration

You will now need to register the browser extension and tie it to your identity.

After your browser extension is installed, you see a __Click Here to Register your Access Control Extension__ link in a blue bar at the top of any new tab that you open. Please click this link to
start the Registration process.

![TODO](images/browser-msg.png "Browser message")

Following this you will see a blue popup on the browser which will ask you for the registration code that confirms your identity. Please go back to your email and retrieve the email from Thycotic which was sent to you with the title __Thycotic Initial Set Up__. Inside this email you will find a registration code that looks like _abcdK-4788f9830_ or something similar. Please __copy__ the entire code and paste it in the pop up and then click on the __Submit__ button.

![TODO](images/reg-code.png "Enter the Registration Code")

Please note that after you click the Submit button, it will take 2-5 secs for your registration code to be registered, please be patient. You will then see the pop up change and ask you to specify a __Master Password__. This master password will be used if necessary to verify your identity in case you lose your phone, or additional verification is required for a successful login. Please choose a strong password, that you can remember.

![TODO](images/master-pw.png "Master Password")

The goal of the master password is to help you login with a password, infrequently and only under special circumstances. In the stable operation for OID, you should never have to enter or worry about passwords. Please enter a strong password with numbers and characters, like __TheD@y1sGr8__
or similar. Click __Submit__ and on the next popup press __Continue__.

Congratulations! You have now completed the first stage of the Thycotic Access Control registration process. You have successfully registered the Thycotic browser extension, tied your identity with the extension. This will help you login to various web enabled corporate resources and never have to worry about password resets, remembering passwords, worrying about if your account can be compromised and more.
