Thycotic has the power to block organization users for accessing unwanted websites that fall in some sensitive categories such as Adult, Social, Gambling, Gaming and Torrents.

In addition, provides you with the ability to extend the list of blocked websites by adding your own URLs or allow some of the ones that already exists in the default list.

## Add Organization Blocked URLs

If you wish to extend the list of blocked URLs,

1. click __Block URL__ located in the top right hand side of the main panel.

   ![blocked url/domain](images/blocked-url.png "Add new blocked URL/domain")
1. On the __Add a new blocked url/domain__ modal, select from __Select a category__ drop-down the content category.
1. For __Enter new url__ add the URL to be blocked.
1. Click __Block__.

Now, your newly added URL is displayed in the blocked URLs table at the top of the main panel. Click __Remove__ at any time you want to delete any URL from the table that no longer needs to be blocked.

## Enable/Disable Blocked Categories

You are able to prevent your organization users from accessing unwanted websites by blocking URLs that fall in some sensitive categories (See Web Filtering for more details).

Under __Categories__ is a list showing all available filtered categories. Check the box next to each category to enable blocking to every website that belongs to it.

### Add Organization Exception URL

Similar with adding your own blocked URLs, you can whitelist some of the default blocked URLs. Click on __Exceptions__ on the bottom right corner of the main panel and then select one of the filtered categories that the desired URL belongs to.

Then choose the desired URL from the list and click __Add Exception__ to save your changes.

The newly allowed URL will be displayed in the table at the bottom of the main panel. Click __Remove__ at any time to delete any URL from the table that no longer needs to be allowed.
