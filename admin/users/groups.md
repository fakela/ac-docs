# Create Group

Thycotic Access Control categorizes users into groups based on the available applications and the level of access. Hence, you will probably need to create multiple user groups with certain settings. To do so, click on the __Add Group__ button located at the top right hand corner of the main panel.

Enter a name for the new group and select its parent group. Remember that groups in the access controller are formatted in a parent - child tree structure.

Then, from the left column, select the applications you want to be available to the group users. Click __Add selected__ and the selected applications will be displayed under __Active applications__ section. Follow the opposite procedure to remove an application from the active applications list. By default, every group has a list of restricted URLs and blocked elements. During group creation, you are able to select any URLs or elements from the corresponding section and add them to the allowed URLs or unblocked elements section respectively. Finally, click __Create__ for changes to take effect.

You are able to edit group settings later as well.

>**Caution**: If an LDAP service is running, this may create inconsistencies in the current organization schema.

You are able to set a global master password for every organization user by checking the box and entering the desired password in the text fields below .
