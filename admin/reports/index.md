# Reports

The __Report Panel__ is where application usage, server and users analytics are displayed.

Under __Active notifications__ you can view every login attempt that is being performed by organization users in real time (Figure 7.1). You are being informed about the status of the login attempt, the user performing this action and in which server as well as the Policy he is using to login. You can also prevent the user from logging in by clicking the button at the far right column.
