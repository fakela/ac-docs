## Notifications

![TODO](images/note-panel.png "Notifications panel")

Use __Notifications__ panel to enable or disable notifications sent when certain actions are taking place in either Onion ID panel or BE by organization users.
Notifications are divided in 3 categories based on their type. Reports, Alerts and Admin Operations.
You can either enable/disable notifications that refer to users or admins globally from the main two switches at the top of the panel or set the state of each notification switch next to its description separately.

### Reports

The Thycotic Access Control solution can sent an email with a daily digest report to every admin regarding login statistics and usage of resources.

All users, including admins, can also receive a weekly report regarding personal activity.
Set those switches to __On__ if you wish to receive report notifications.

### Alerts

Enable these notifications if you wish to receive an email every time someone uninstalls a BE or tries to run a blocked command over SSH.

### Admin Operations

Notifications listed under this subsection have to do with actions performed by admins such as update user or unblock BE. This is helpful when you want to keep track of important procedures that happen in the panel in a multi-admin organization.
