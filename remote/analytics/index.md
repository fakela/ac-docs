# User Analytics Overview

This topic provides an overview of the various options available to customers for User Analytics, built in by default, into the the Remote Access Controller product.

The Remote Access Controller ties in with directory structures like Microsoft AD and LDAP and can pull user information from these systems into the Remote Access Controller. As a next step the Remote Access Controller can associate which user, part of various groups, are visiting different applications and servers. This helps the Remote Access Controller depict in a graphical manner to the customer, who has access to which applications and servers and how much access they have. Below we present a live example of the kind of user analytics that customers can see on the Remote Access Controller dashboard.
