This documentation repository contains general information pertaining to privilege managed access technology in general and how any of these products can secure your infrastructure in specific areas or as a integrated multi-product solution.

* Infrastructure Access Management - Makes sure that only employees get access to organizations´ Cloud Servers and Containers. With a zero software agent approach no server modifications are needed.

* Dynamic Privilege Management - Helps organizations to easily specify which employee can access what on a website or server. Each action is risk scored using machine learning to detect and prevent threats. Policy setup is easy, flexible and no server or website changes are needed.

* Activity Monitoring - Organizations can easily find out which servers, applications and websites employees are using, as well as have access to detailed reports on alerts and invalid actions. With employee session recording, time to compile forensic and compliance reports is considerably reduced.

* License Management - Organizations can get detailed reports on how well their employees are utilizing money spent on cloud services and identify accounts that are not used. Organizations can reduce their threat risk profile and costs.

* Invisible Identity Verification - Helps employees get access to what they need without putting up roadblocks. Two Factor Authentication can be a nuisance. There is no need for 8 digit code login and no hardware to carry. With multiple choices like Geofencing, Geoproximity, AirShake, and Touch ID, the access control solution conveniently merges security and usability.

* User Management - With automatic password resets and LDAP/AD integration, the access control solution makes life easier by integrating with organization´s central directory to maintain a single source of truth. Templates help to automatically create user accounts for new employees and disable accounts for the ones that are no longer employed.
