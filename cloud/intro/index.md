# Cloud Access Controller - SaaS PAM

The Cloud Access Controller secures privileges for accounts on Cloud Servers (AWS, Rackspace, SoftLayer, private clouds), Containers (Docker, CoreOS) and Web Applications (Salesforce, GitHub, Office365, Google) in 60 seconds.

Easy User Management, easy access management for SaaS applications, easy MFA for Legacy Web applications and 3rd party SaaS dashboards, separation of roles and duties on Web Services and Dashboards â€“ all in one convenient single pane of glass for PAM (Privileged Access Management).

The Cloud Access Controller provides an easy Privilege Grant and Management mechanism for SaaS and legacy web applications. Customers can safely share administrative account access on SaaS applications with multiple employees, while ensuring that each employee can only utilize the minimum functionality necessary for their job function. The Cloud Access Controller helps insert a transparent Privilege Management layer so
customers can choose to use their favorite SaaS and web applications and yet be able to demonstrate separate of roles and duties on shared accounts. This is truly the best of both worlds: SOX, SOC2, PCI, NIST, FFIEC, NCUA, NERC, ISO, GDPR guidelines can be respected for compliance and auditing purposes while sales, marketing, HR, IT and other teams can continue to use their chosen SaaS
applications with zero interruption.

## SaaS PAM Benefits

### Compliance

Clearly demonstrate Separation Of Duties and Roles based on Active Directory/LDAP/Workday group membership on SaaS applications or Web applications that do not have sufficient user identity separation.

### Auditing

Capability to Audit who has access to what. Drill in deeper to see how much access a person has inside any application, what can they do, and what can they not do. This helps with visibility into how highly sensitive portions of a SaaS applications are being used (e.g. Wire Transfer area in your banking account).

### Security

Set up checkpoints inside web applications and SaaS solutions without modifying a single line of code. Specify how employees can navigate the checkpoints to prove their identity and register their intent to perform a sensitive action. Prevent insider threats and lower risks of compromised accounts.

### Sample Workflow

* IT Admin of customer (ITA) visit any SaaS application or web application in any browser.

* ITA can click on any button, form, piece of text to register it with The Cloud Access Controller as a sensitive action or piece of information.

* The Cloud Access Controller automatically syncs with Active Directory, LDAP and other directory services.

* ITA can simply visit the The Cloud Access Controller dashboard, navigate to the configuration page for the SaaS application and then drag and drop which sensitive actions (previously registered with mouse clicks) can be used by certain groups of people.

* As employees visit the SaaS application, The Cloud Access Controller checks their group membership in real time and prevents employees from seeing sensitive text, clicking buttons, filling forms based on the policies set up by the ITA.

* ITA can now generate automated compliance reports to show auditors what every person has access to and which functionality and data for a SaaS application are walled off from certain user groups.

* Employees can request access to walled off features and information in real time by just clicking on a request button and filling out the rationale.

* ITA can accept the request and grant privileges for employee to fulfill their task. This provides an auditing loop to track privilege requests and privilege grants.

* Additionally, ITA can request a video session recording of the employee performing sensitive actions and comply with the trust but verify model.
